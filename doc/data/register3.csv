 [7\.\.\.0] ,**When Read** : Reads each pin's Input/Output conditions:
 ,1 = the pin is set to output
 ,0 = the pin is set to input with internal pullup
 ,**When Write** : Sets each pin's Input/Output configurations:
 ,1: sets the pin to an Output. output level is set by
 ,corresponding bit of GPIO0_STAT register
 ,0: sets the pin to an Input with internal pull-up connected
